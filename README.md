## Chef RPG

This application is a browser-based game in which the player can choose one of four characters and proceed to battle the remaining three. Written in javascript and jquery, this application demonstrates a basic DOM element targeting and uses css classes to control the status of each character when in different phases of the game.

## To Play

Click on a chef's portrait to choose your character. Then, carefully choose your opponents one by one and click the Fight button to do battle.

Your character's attack power will increase with each attack, so pay attention to the opponents with high counterattack values. Be the last chef standing to reign supreme in this kitchen!
